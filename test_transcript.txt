Welcome to the Evolution Stables horse report for First Gear. This is Stephen Gray Racing with an update on our latest training session.

First Gear has been showing revolutionary progress in his conditioning work this week. The horse is absolutely game-changing in his approach to the training regime. We're disrupting the traditional methods and seeing incredible results.

The horse was worked over 1200 meters this morning and the time was exceptional. He's moving really well and the feedback from the jockey was very positive. We're optimistic about his chances in the upcoming race.

The horse has been eating well and his coat is looking fantastic. We've been working on his fitness and he's responding brilliantly to the program. The team is excited about what's to come.

That's all for this week's update. We'll keep you posted on First Gear's progress as we move towards race day.
